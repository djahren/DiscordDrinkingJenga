Suggestions from Birfday:
	Fashionista: add "everyone". maybe check other tiles for language consistency

	maybe make the order of drinking jenga automatically alphabetical (if it is possible)?
		might be able to do? getting ahold of server nicknames is unfortunately not very easy from the discord api
		and by "not easy" I mean potentially not possible; as you've probably noticed, unless it's an @ mention the bot never uses nicknames, and that's something that gets processed after the message leaves the bot

	Off With Their Panties!:
		Remove article of underwear
		/socks
